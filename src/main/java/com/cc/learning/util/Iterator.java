 * An iterator over a collection.  {@code Iterator} takes the place of

 *      <li> Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the
 *           underlying collection during the iteration with well-defined
 *           semantics.
 *      <li> Method names have been improved.
 * </ul>

 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
